OVERVIEW:

fastq-mcf

Scans a sequence file for adapters, and, based on a log-scaled threshold, determines a set of clipping parameters and performs clipping. Also does skewing detection and quality filtering.

fastq-multx

Demultiplexes a fastq. Capable of auto-determining barcode id's based on a master set fields. Keeps multiple reads in-sync during demultiplexing. Can verify that the reads are in-sync as well, and fail if they're not.


fastq-join
Similar to audy's stitch program, but in C, more efficient and supports some automatic benchmarking and tuning. It uses the same "squared distance for anchored alignment" as other tools.

fastq-stats
Outputs stats for fastqs

sam-stats
Output stats for sam/bam files

varcall
Variant caller, takes bam or pileup output and does variant calling with advanced features like PCR duplicate filtering, homopolymer repeat filtering, calculation of error rate and dectectibility (minimum percentage) thresholds.

REQUIRES:

For building sam-stats, please install this first!

QUICK FAQ:

This is based on feedback/emails, etc.

fastq-mcf does a 100k sub-sampling to determine what to do.   There are lots of paramters to play with, but the "automatic" mode should do the right thing most of the time.  If it doesn't, I really would like to hear why/what it did.  The point in this tool is that the basic quality and adapter filtering should be something that's done automagically 90% of the time - not by manually picking paramters for each run.   The fact that it's making decisions "for the user" means it will probably change more over time than the other tools.  

If you want fastq-mcf to be similar to other tools, you need to pass -f (force run, regardless of heuristic), also pass -m XX, and -s 100, so it's a fixed-length.  If you try running with unrealistic, or "test" data, the heuristic won't work.  Instead, try with a subsample of 500 or so "real" reads.

fastq-join produces a "report".  This is just a list of lengths of joined reads.   Also it chooses the "better quality base" when overlapping.  Very stable code at this point.

fastq-multx is intended to keep mates in sync, so you can demultiplex in one-pass.  For single-reads, it's not better than other tools out there.  Also, notice the output file's "%-sign" substitution... this is instead of lots of prefix and suffix arguments.  Mismatch algorithm is "maximal unique"... ie... if it's possible that 2 barcodes can match, it won't use *either*.   Qualities are ignored.  Very stable code at this point.

INSTALL:

Should be able to run "make install" on most machines that have g++ installed.  On windows, install a copy of the MinGW environment.

Example:

PREFIX=/usr make install

Or

CC=g++ PREFIX=/usr/local make install
